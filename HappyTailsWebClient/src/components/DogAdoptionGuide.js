      <h1>Guide for the Adoptive Family</h1>

      <p>
        Imagine arriving at a new house without choosing it. The people are unfamiliar, and you don't understand their language.
        The taste of the food is strange, and you're uncertain about where to find drinks. The new bed, sounds, and scents are unfamiliar.
        This is precisely how a dog feels in a new home.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the initial weeks of adoption, it's crucial to exercise boundless patience and shower your new furry friend with love gently.
        Whether you've adopted a puppy missing its mother and siblings or an adult dog adapting to a new environment, understanding their emotions is essential.
      </p>

      <h2>Essentials to Prepare at Home for Your New Dog:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A cozy and soft bed</li>
        <li>Water bowl</li>
        <li>Food bowl</li>
        <li>Appropriate food for the dog's age and size</li>
        <li>Collar</li>
        <li>Walking leash (not a flexi leash)</li>
        <li>Chew toys</li>
        <li>Training treats</li>
        <li>If you've adopted a puppy, consider using training pads</li>
        <li>cage training</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Important things to know</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs perceive the world as a pack, and the family adopting a dog should be the 'pack leader.' Establishing a sense of security and protection is crucial.
        Avoid displays of dominance and focus on creating positive and lasting memories through gentle corrections and positive reinforcement.
      </p>

      <h2>Exposure to the Environment</h2>
      <p>
        Introduce your dog to various stimuli in their new environment, including people, children, other dogs, and different sounds.
        Increased exposure contributes to a calmer and more relaxed demeanor in various situations. Building confidence through exposure fosters a positive attitude toward new encounters.
      </p>

      <h2>Proper Walking Etiquette</h2>
      <p>
        Remember that you are taking the dog for a walk, and not the other way around. Teach your dog to walk on the same side consistently.
        Allow stops for sniffing and exploration, but maintain control. If your dog pulls on the leash, correct with a firm 'no,' and reinforce positive behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Before Entering the House for the First Time</h2>
      <p>
        Take a walk with your dog in the street, allowing them to explore and scent-mark. After the walk, show your dog the location of their food and water bowls.
        Let them familiarize themselves with their bed and walk around all the rooms to establish a sense of safety.
